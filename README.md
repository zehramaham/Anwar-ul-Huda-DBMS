# Anwar-ul-Huda Database Management System

This is the database of Anwar-ul-Huda Hostel, Skardu; an all-girls orphanage, under the management of Anwar-ul-Huda Trust, owned by Muhammad Hussain Raeesi, collaborative partner Hussaini Foundation.  The orphanage caters to the needs of 155 orphaned girls between the ages of 4-19 years.  It was setup in May 2012 in a small rented house with 25 girls, the numbers increased gradually.Striving to maintain a proper system, Anwar-ul-Huda hostel saves the data in hard-copies but with the increase in number of girls, the data is getting hard to secure and maintain.  This system was built to ensure that the data is confined to one location, to as to make viewing, editing, and insertion easier, as well as, easier to share information with sponsors.
